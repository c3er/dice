# Dice Substitution

A dice substitution on a single HTML page. Useful if you want to play a board game or similar and don't have some dice to hand.

It should run with every modern browser - though with issues in certain ones, see below.

It was tested with:

- Mozilla Firefox
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge

Internet Explorer is not supported.

## Notes

### Storing of settings (count and range of dice)

If Google Chrome is set to not store third-party-cookies, it will not store the dice settings. The only known way to let Chrome store those settings is to allow third-party-cookies.

Microsoft Edge will not store the settings as long as the file is not accessed via a web server. See [this Stack Overflow entry](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32376234).

At Mozilla Firefox, there was no problem observed.
